# slideshows-sliders
For a very long time, I have been working with sliders. Before the advent of OWL SLIDER ,BX SLIDER and tons of other fantastic sliders, we were building our own sliders.  So sharing some of the specific sliders which I used so far. There are tons of other sliders online. The ones I am sharing are easy and customisable and be used for specific purpose.


Feel free to download and upgrade the existing ones. If you have any new changes, please update the code repository. 

Thanks.
